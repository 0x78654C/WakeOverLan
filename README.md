# WakeOverLan
I'm a simple coder and want to share this first published project with you.
This a simple Wake Over Lan for Windows and Android users.
The project came from the ideea of code transparency in a tool. I kind of had enough of closed source wich you never know
what they do beside the purpose of it.

The project can be updated for your needs and requirements.
