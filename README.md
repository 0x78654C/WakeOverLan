# WakeOverLan
I'm a simple coder and want to share this first project with you.
This a simple Wake Over Lan for Windows and Android users.
The project came from the ideea of code transparency in a tool. I kind of had enough of closed source wich you never know
what they do beside the purpose of it.

The project can be updated for your needs and requirements.

Windows project:

Is build in C# under .NET Framework 4.5 for more compatibility among Windows users.

It saves last machine settings that was opened.

Android project:


Is build andoird users that has Android O and up.

It saves last machine settings that was opened.

If you like the project you can donate to my paypal: l2xguard@live.com
