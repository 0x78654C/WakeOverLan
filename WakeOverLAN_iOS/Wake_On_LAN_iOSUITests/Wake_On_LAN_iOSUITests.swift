    Description: This a simple Wake Over Lan app that that came from the idea of code transparency
    and not closed source where you some times don't know what the app really dose even if is free or not..
    Usage: Is made for 1 machine only. You add the IP/Hostname(internal or external ), MAC address, and WOL port(Depending on your motherboard, the
    default port is 9 or can be changed by desire).
    Requirements: iOS 11+
	Awake library from: https://github.com/jesper-lindberg/Awake   (thank you very much)
